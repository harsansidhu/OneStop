# OneStop
An Android application that gives you directions to the closest location for food.

Using the Google Places API for web services as well as the LocationManager class for Android, this application finds a list of the nearest open food businesses given the user's current location. 

Using an intent, the business's latitude and longitude is then opened in Google Maps and the user is given directions from their current location to that business. 

Happy eating!
