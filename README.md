# OneStop
An Android application that gives you directions to the closest locations for food.

Using the Google Places API for web services as well as the LocationManager class for Android, this application finds a list of the nearest open food businesses given the user's current location. 

A list of businesses, sorted from nearest to furthest, is displayed. The user can pick whichever business they like and are given directions to that location

Happy eating!
